# Task 2: Quantitative Stock Analysis Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook (`task2_stock_analysis.ipynb`) contains the **quantitative analysis** part of the News Driven Stock Analysis project for **Week 1, Task 2**.

---

## Purpose

- Perform quantitative analysis on stock price data using **PyNance** and **TA-Lib**.
- Calculate and visualize technical indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD.
- Use prepared and clean stock data loaded into pandas DataFrames.
- Visualize data trends and indicator effects on stock prices.

---

## Important Notes

- The notebook focuses on **analysis and visualization** only.
- All core functions and classes used in this notebook are **modularized** and implemented separately inside the [`script/`](../script) folder.
- This separation allows for cleaner, reusable, and maintainable code.

---

## How to Use

1. Ensure all dependencies (PyNance, TA-Lib, pandas, matplotlib, etc.) are installed.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to load data, calculate indicators, and generate visualizations.
3. Review the outputs and charts to understand stock behavior based on technical indicators.
