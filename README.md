# News Driven Stock Analysis – Task 3

This branch (`task-3`) focuses on exploring the **correlation between news sentiment and stock price movements**. It builds on earlier tasks by introducing sentiment analysis and correlation techniques using Python, further expanding the project's quantitative and data-driven scope.

## 🌐 Objective

To analyze how financial news sentiment influences stock price changes by:

- Performing **sentiment analysis** on news data.
- Aligning news with stock data to identify potential correlations.
- Visualizing sentiment impact on stock behavior over time.

## 📌 Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Apply tools like VADER or TextBlob to assess the polarity of news headlines or content.
- **Data Synchronization**: Match sentiment timestamps with corresponding stock prices.
- **Correlation Metrics**: Calculate Pearson, Spearman, or custom metrics to quantify relationships.
- **Modular Code Design**: Core logic resides in the `scripts/` directory for reusability and clarity.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of sentiment trends and price shifts to detect patterns.
