# 📰📈 News Driven Stock Analysis – Week 1

This repository is part of a multi-stage project focused on analyzing how financial news affects stock price behavior. Using Python, finance APIs, sentiment analysis tools, and visualization libraries, the project evolves across tasks — from technical stock analysis to correlating news sentiment with market movement.

## ✅ Weekly Breakdown

### 🔹 Task 1: Stock Data Loading & Visualization
- Load historical stock price data.
- Visualize Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
- Basic moving averages (SMA/EMA).

📁 Notebook: `notebooks/task1_stock_data_analysis.ipynb`  
📁 Scripts: `scripts/task1_stock_functions.py`

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Technical Indicator Analysis
- Apply **TA-Lib** to compute:
  - Moving Averages
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Use **PyNance** for advanced metrics.
- Modularize code into reusable functions and classes.

📁 Notebook: `notebooks/task2_stock_analysis.ipynb`  
📁 Scripts: `scripts/task2_stock_analysis.py`

### 🔹 Task 3: News Sentiment & Stock Correlation
- Scrape or load financial news headlines.
- Apply **sentiment analysis** (e.g., VADER/TextBlob).
- Synchronize sentiment with stock data.
- Compute correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman).
- Visualize insights.
