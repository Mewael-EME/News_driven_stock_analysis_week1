# News Driven Stock Analysis - Task 2

This branch (`task-2`) contains the developments for **Week 1, Task 2** of the News Driven Stock Analysis project, focusing on advanced quantitative analysis using Python libraries like **PyNance** and **TA-Lib**.

---

## Overview

Task 2 builds upon the foundational work done in Task 1 by incorporating additional financial data and implementing technical analysis indicators to deepen stock price insights.

---

## Main Features

- **Expanded Data Handling**  
  Load and prepare comprehensive stock price datasets including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume columns.

- **Technical Indicators with TA-Lib**  
  Calculate and analyze moving averages (SMA, EMA), RSI, MACD, and other common indicators to better understand market trends.

- **Financial Metrics Using PyNance**  
  Integrate PyNance tools to compute additional financial metrics supporting quantitative stock analysis.

- **Data Visualization**  
  Create informative visualizations to explore stock trends and the effects of technical indicators.

- **Code Modularization**  
  Core analysis logic is modularized inside the `scripts/` folder, making the codebase maintainable and reusable.  
  The Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/task2_stock_analysis.ipynb`) uses these modules to perform the analysis and visualization.
